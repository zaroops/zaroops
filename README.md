## **Welcome**,

My name is Zachary, also known by my github alias, zaroops. 

I'm an aspiring hacker/red teamer based in New York City. 

I have my AZ-900 Azure Fubdamentals Certification and my Comptia Security+ Certification, and I am currently studying for my CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Administrator) Certification. 

My skills include Computer Networking (TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, VPN, LAN/WAN fundamentals), IT troubleshooting basics, Python Proficiency, Active Directory, Kali Linux, and HTML/CSS. I am currently focused on learning
my CCNA material as well as tryhackme/hackthebx material to participate in CTFs. 

I suppose the goal of this is to document my learning and to hold myself accountable to learning as much as I can and achieving my goals. 

My favorite tools are: VMWare Workstation Pro, Kali Linux, NotebookLM, and Visual Studio Code.
